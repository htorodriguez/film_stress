# film_stress
R App to calculate film stress based on bow measurements 

# Getting Started
Run the app from R studio 

# Data
The app is based on bow measurements on <100> oriented Silicon wafers. the poisson number is approximated with 0.28 and the Youngs modulus with 130 GPa. For the extrapolation to silicon carbide 4H <0001> wafers I use 0.14 as poissons number and 400GPa as Youngs modulus  

# Example
The app is running on the R Studio server
